# TargetPractice

Simple game using hand tracking (via [ARUnderstanding](https://github.com/johnhaney/ARUnderstanding)) to aim at a target.

The target is a cylinder with a Shader Graph Material to paint the rings.

Collision detection assigns points based on the collision location from the center.
