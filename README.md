# TargetPractice

Simple game using hand tracking to aim at a target. Uses [HandGesture](https://github.com/johnhaney/HandGesture) (built on [ARUnderstanding](https://github.com/johnhaney)) for hand tracking and detecting "finger gun" gesture to fire.

The target is a cylinder with a Shader Graph Material to paint the rings.

Collision detection assigns points based on the collision location from the center.
